You are analyzing technical specification documents for hardware components used in projects like drones, robots, or electronics prototypes.

Extract ALL component specifications from the following text and tables. Focus on:

**1. Component Identification:**
- Name and model number
- Manufacturer
- Component type (motor, sensor, camera, processor, battery, ESC, etc.)

**2. Power Specifications:**
- Voltage (input/output ranges)
- Current rating or consumption
- Power consumption in Watts/milliwatts
- Battery capacity (mAh) if applicable

**3. Communication Interfaces:**
- Count of UART, I2C, SPI, CAN, USB ports
- Protocol support
- Voltage levels (3.3V, 5V)

**4. Component-Specific Specs:**
- **Motors**: KV rating, max current, operating voltage, RPM
- **Cameras**: Resolution, FPS, interface type, FOV
- **Processors**: Clock speed, RAM, Flash, architecture
- **Sensors**: Type (IMU, GPS, etc.), range, accuracy, update rate
- **Batteries**: Voltage, capacity (mAh), cell count, chemistry
- **ESCs**: Current rating, supported protocols
- **Radio**: Frequency, channel count, range

**Text:**

Return a JSON array of components in this format:
```json

```

Be thorough - extract EVERY component mentioned. If multiple components are described, return multiple objects.
If a value is not found, omit that field or use null.
