Analyze the following components for a hardware project (likely a drone or robot) and identify compatibility issues:

**Components:**
{components}

Check for:

1. **Power Compatibility**
   - Do voltage levels match?
   - Is total current draw reasonable for a single battery?
   - Are there components with conflicting voltage requirements?
   - Do any components exceed the power supply capabilities?

2. **Interface Conflicts**
   - Does the processor have enough UART/I2C/SPI ports for all peripherals?
   - Are there duplicate device addresses on I2C?
   - Protocol mismatches?
   - Voltage level compatibility (3.3V vs 5V)?

3. **Physical Constraints**
   - Motor KV rating appropriate for voltage?
   - ESC current rating sufficient for motors?
   - Battery capacity adequate for power draw?
   - Weight distribution concerns?

4. **Missing Critical Components**
   - Power regulation (if needed)?
   - Level shifters (3.3V ↔ 5V)?
   - Connectors and wiring?
   - Essential sensors or controllers?

Return JSON:
```json
{{
  "issues": [
    "Critical compatibility issue description",
    "Another critical issue..."
  ],
  "warnings": [
    "Potential concern or warning...",
    "Another warning..."
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Suggested fix or addition...",
    "Another recommendation..."
  ]
}}
```

Focus on practical, actionable issues that would prevent the system from working correctly.
